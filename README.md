# Spam Detector - AI

Developed a Python-based spam detector using the Naive Bayes approach.

Implemented a probabilistic model from the training set. Used libraries like NumPy, math, re, os and Matplotlib. Classifier classifies test set into ham class or spam class. 

Built a table of results showing the accuracy, precision, recall and F1-measure for each class (spam and ham), as well as a confusion matrix.
